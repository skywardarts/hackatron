With the world left in pieces from the attack by the vicious species knowna as the X

You find yourself as if inside a virtual world. What is this place?

Old Man:
Hahaha, you want to know?



You have memories of a world

Humans evolved to be able to produce an aura from the pores on their skin, controlling this aura is the art of Magicka.

Aura is the life energy produced by all living bodies vital for survival. Aura from all parts of the body has a tendency to flow together, producing one mass of energy. This happens without the individual's awareness, typically resulting in a slow leak of magicka continually escaping the body.[1] If one were to lose their entire aura, it would be equivalent to using up all the energy keeping them alive, which would be fatal. The pores or points on the body from which aura flows out from are called "aura pores". Controlling those nodes is the first step to being a user of Magicka.
